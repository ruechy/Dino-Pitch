Simple guitar tuner sample app with BSD license.

There are plenty of tuners out there, this one is designed to be easy to understand and follow. It should also be easy to port to other platforms, though right now it compiles only on OS X and Linux.

To Compile:

OS X and Linux only :(patches for other apps accepted!)
Download and install portaudio.
For OS X, use homebrew or macports to install -- port install portaudio.
For Ubuntu, use apt-get install portaudio19-dev.
run "make"
the output is ./tuner

More Info

This tuner app works by calculating the magnatude of the FFT, which is not the ideal method, but it works well enough.
